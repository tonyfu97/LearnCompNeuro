# LearnCompNeuro
Materials I used for mentoring in introductory computational and visual neuroscience, featuring a study plan, curated questions, and hands-on projects


I was tasked to mentor a student for my lab. 
The lectures I used are the [Neuronal Dynamics - Computational Neuroscience by Wulfram Gerstner](https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/NeuronalDynamics-MOOCall.html)
Because our lab focus on visual neuroscience, I added a small book that is very well written: [Vision and Brain: How We Perceive the World (The MIT Press)](https://a.co/d/3DHt2II)
Those two are very approachable learning materials that give a nice quick overview of the field. and minimizing head scratching. The student will read/watch one chapter each week.

In addition, the student will have hands-on project on spiking neural network using [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai). 

# LearnCompNeuro: A Guide to Introductory Computational and Visual Neuroscience

This repository contains educational resources that I've used for mentoring students in introductory computational and visual neuroscience. It features a study plan, targeted questions, and hands-on projects.

The primary materials for these sessions are derived from the Neuronal Dynamics - Computational Neuroscience written by Wulfram Gerstner](https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/NeuronalDynamics-MOOCall.html). In line with our lab's focus on visual neuroscience, I've also included an excellent and digestible book, [Vision and Brain: How We Perceive the World (The MIT Press)](https://a.co/d/3DHt2II). Both sources offer an accessible overview of the field, and hopefully this would minimize the head-scratching for those who are just starting out. The learning schedule is designed such that students will engage with one chapter each week.

Supplementing this, students will be introduced to hands-on projects involving spiking neural networks using [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai) a few weeks into the study plan.

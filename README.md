# LearnCompNeuro: A Guide to Introductory Computational and Visual Neuroscience

This repository contains educational resources that I've used for mentoring students in introductory computational and visual neuroscience. It features a study plan, targeted questions, and hands-on projects.

The primary materials for these sessions are derived from the [Neuronal Dynamics - Computational Neuroscience by Wulfram Gerstner](https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/NeuronalDynamics-MOOCall.html). In line with our lab's focus on visual neuroscience, I've also included an excellent and digestible book, [Vision and Brain: How We Perceive the World by James V. Stone](https://a.co/d/3DHt2II). Both sources offer an accessible overview of the field, and hopefully this would minimize the head-scratching for those who are just starting out. The learning schedule is designed such that students will engage with one chapter each week.

Supplementing this, students will be introduced to hands-on projects involving spiking neural networks using [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai) a few weeks into the study plan.

## 2. Generate stimulus set


### 2.1 Generate HD version of the stimulus set

I would recommend generating high-definition version of the stimulus set first, and then resize them later for your specific layers.

Look at this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Pfu1hcJq6U2f3XTKA_fuPtRV6xH0f72c#scrollTo=G7OCGOQkSFH9)

Here is my version of it:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ROTATION_INCREMENT = 45  # 45 degrees increment for rotations

class Shape:
    def __init__(self, coords):
        self.coords = np.array(coords).reshape(len(coords)//2, 2)
        self.sampled_coords = self._sample_shape(self.coords)

    @staticmethod
    def _sample_shape(invec):
        sample = 50.0
        num = np.shape(invec)[0]
        inshft = np.vstack((invec[num-2,:], invec, invec[1,:]))
        ip = np.arange(0, 50, 1) / sample

        vtx, vty = [], []
        for i in range(0, num-1):
            bufvrt = inshft[i:i+4,:]
            incr = [
                -ip**3 + 3*ip**2 - 3*ip + 1,
                3*ip**3 - 6*ip**2 + 4,
                -3*ip**3 + 3*ip**2 + 3*ip + 1,
                ip**3
            ]
            vtx.extend(np.sum(np.tile(bufvrt[:,0].reshape(4,1), (1, len(ip))) * incr, axis=0) / 6.0)
            vty.extend(np.sum(np.tile(bufvrt[:,1].reshape(4,1), (1, len(ip))) * incr, axis=0) / 6.0)

        return np.array(list(zip(vtx, vty)))

    def rotate(self, rotation_index):
        rot_angle = rotation_index * ROTATION_INCREMENT * np.pi / 180.0
        rotX = np.cos(rot_angle) * self.sampled_coords[:,0] + np.sin(rot_angle) * self.sampled_coords[:,1]
        rotY = -np.sin(rot_angle) * self.sampled_coords[:,0] + np.cos(rot_angle) * self.sampled_coords[:,1]
        return rotX, rotY

    def render(self, rotation_index=0, img_size=(16, 16), background_color='k', shape_color='w', fill_shape=True):
        plt.figure(figsize=img_size)
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.fill([-4.0, 4.0, 4.0, -4.0], [-4.0, -4.0, 4.0, 4.0], background_color)

        rotX, rotY = self.rotate(rotation_index)
        if fill_shape:
            plt.fill(rotX, rotY, shape_color)
        else:
            plt.plot(rotX, rotY, color=shape_color)
        plt.show()  # You probably want to return the numpy array instead of showing it

# Example Usage:
shape_coords = [-0.294,0.122,-0.075,0.846,0.0,1.6,0.054,0.983,0.257,0.401,0.605,-0.111,1.071,-0.516,1.248,-0.848,1.131,-1.131,0.85,-1.25,0.57,-1.131,0.179,-0.871,-0.282,-0.78,-0.742,-0.871,-1.131,-1.131,-0.651,-0.546,-0.294,0.122]
shape = Shape(shape_coords)
shape.render(1, img_size=(6, 6), background_color='g', shape_color='y', fill_shape=False)
```

### 2.2 Rescale the stimulus set according to the RF and XN size of the layer.

Check out `model_info.txt` for the RF and XN size of the layer.

## 3. Get the model response

1. Get the pretrained model
2. Get the response up to the layer of interest
3. Get only the center responses of the layer of interest
4. Store the responses in a numpy array? or in a text file? 


## 4. Analyze the model response

Plot some plots, etc.
